    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Beef rendang is one of the original cuisines of Minangkabau descent and Sumatraâ€™s culture. 
        It is served at special occasions to honor guests and during festive seasons. 
        It is a delicious Indonesian dish prepared with a myriad of herbs and spices cooking for a few hours 
        until all the liquids have been completely absorbed by the meat. Beef rendang is best eaten with steamed rice and condiments 
        such as fried onions and chili pieces.

        <li>6 garlic cloves, chopped</li>
        <li>12 large red chilis, chopped</li>
        <li>2 tsp chopped ginger</li>
        <li>2 tbsp chopped galangal</li>
        <li>salt, to taste</li>
        <li>4 tsp ground candlenut</li>
        <li>2 tbsp ground white pepper</li>
        <li>1 tsp ground cardamom</li>
        <li>2 tbsp ground coriander</li>
        <li>2 tbsp ground cumin</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp ground nutmeg</li>
        <li>0.6 cm piece star anise</li>
        <li>1 stalk lemongrass (center only), minced</li>
        <li>1/2 cup grapeseed oil</li>
        <li>1/2 cup water</li>
        <li>1 liter coconut cream, 24 percent fat content</li>
        <li>2 turmeric leaves (can substitute bay leaf if turmeric not available), leaves can be left whole. If using turmeric root, 
            grate into spice paste</li>
        <li>4 leaves kaffir lime</li>
        <li>Reserve 1 tbsp of cumin, 1 tbsp of coriander, 1 tbsp of ground white pepper for beef</li>
        <li>1/2 cup grapeseed oil for beef</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Methods</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a blender, combine all ingredients for the spice paste (except turmeric, lime leaves and coconut cream) and blend until smooth.</li>
        <li>In a large wok or pot, add turmeric and lime leaves to the spice paste and start to cook on medium heat, stirring constantly until aromatic.</li>
        <li>Add coconut cream and stir to combine. Bring to a simmer and cook, stirring constantly to ensure the mixture doesn't burn, about one hour.</li>
        <li>Using a bowl, season beef tenderloin cubes with salt, pepper, cumin and coriander. 
            In a separate pan, heat pan with grapeseed oil and sear the beef on all sides until dark brown.</li>
        <li>Add beef to wok and continue simmering, stirring constantly, as the coconut liquid reduces 
            and the natural oil in the coconut cream starts to separate the mixture and turn golden brown.</li>
        <li>Continue stirring until mixture starts to dry and has the texture of wet sand, being extra careful not to burn 
            at this last step to avoid bitterness.</li>
        <li>When the rendang has reached the proper color and the meat is tender, remove the heat and serve with steamed white rice.</li>
    </ol>
